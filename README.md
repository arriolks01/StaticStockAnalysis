# StaticStockAnalysis
My first set of data collected to analyze stock prices and their dividends pay out for passive income

One thing that I am passionate about is fiancail literacy and exploraton. The goal of this project is to simple use the static data collected
from Stash Invest. This included the price of each stock in US dollars and the dividend payout in percentage as of Febuary 14th, 2020.
